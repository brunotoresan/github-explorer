## 🔥 About the project
This is my first ever React project developed watching the Ignite's Rocketseat course by @diego3g. The website gets all Rocketseat's public repositories via GitHub API and lists them with their respective links. In this project I learned a lot of fundamentals, including:
- How to configure the structure of a React project from scratch with Babel, webpack, typescript and SaSS loader
- Webpack Dev Server to automatically update the bundle file
- Source maps for visualize the app's original code in the browser's dev tools
- Using 2 different webpack's environment: Dev (faster) and Prod (optimized)
- Importing and integrating SaSS files
- **React components**
- **Using React State Hook**
- **Using React Effect Hook**
- Learning the `key` property of React (the first element inside a `map` needs a key for React to find it, remove it, etc...)
- How to type components and states with Typescript
- React dev tools to measure and debug the React application
